# DLA
### Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) of a Rectangular Attractor 
## Project Description
The process begins with a deposited molecule, which can originate at the origin, on a surface, or randomly in space. Then, this molecule Randomly walks in space. When it reaches the seed molecule it sticks, in figure 1 that would be the origin, or in b and c the border of the enclosing surface. This process continues and molecules begin sticking to each other until images form like in figure 1. There are different geometries of Diffusion limited aggregation seed particles and also instances such as decreasing particles or particles of various sizes. <br>

## Project Motivation

Diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) is a process defined by, randomly walking particles aggregating. In principle, this process is applicable in every field concerned with the diffusion of particles, e.g. biology, chemistry, physics, etc. Random walks are a Monte Carlo method. Meaning it is an algorithm which relies on random sampling to obtain results. Random walks are used in DLA to model the Brownian motion of particles in a medium. Brownian motion applies to gas, liquid, or solid particles in a liquid or gas colloid. By using a Brownian motion models, by way of Monte Carlo random walk algorithms, the DLA model has become a way to model physical processes of diffusion. <br>

## Conclusion
Producing a rectangular attractor with the DLA process was difficult. There are easier methods to accomplish the same output, albeit with much lower quality. By allowing the particle to move in every direction laterally and diagonally, I have shown high quality DLA defined qualitatively by the branching in the aggregate particles which resemble trees. Using two different animation techniques, I was able to show the process of DLA for a value of “length” less than 5 efficiently. More research into making more efficient animations would be needed to increase the “length” that would be useful to the user and less taxing on the computer. <br>
